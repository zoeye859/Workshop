1
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,860
so I've been thinking about thinking for

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,500
well over 20 years and I think I have

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,460
more questions than I do answers and I

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,580
like to share some of those questions

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,850
with you today now on my journey I've

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,439
been doing a lot of research and in 2009

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,980
and ran across this report that just

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,609
really caught my attention in this

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,980
report

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,950
it's from the company called the

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,590
Millennium project and this organization

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,420
consists of well over 500 scientists

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,489
researchers academics and business

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
people from over 50 different countries

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,829
and this report is called the state of

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,980
future report in the outline of the 15

17
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,449
global challenges facing humanity so the

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,480
things you would expect to see clean

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,379
water population growth energy are all

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,930
on the list it was number 9 that caught

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:06,810
my attention number 9 the capacity to

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,939
decide in other words decision making

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,810
made it on the list of the global

24
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,210
challenges facing humanity lies is the

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,979
case lies decision-making becoming more

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,869
challenging with all the information

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,950
technology and tools that we have

28
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,570
available to us

29
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,759
wise decision making on this list well

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,640
about ten years ago and created this

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,140
model it's very simple but I think it

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,560
does a good job in explaining both the

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,600
problem as well as the opportunity what

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,930
we're finding is that most training

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,640
teaches people what to think that is it

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,350
gives them the processes the procedures

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,380
the methodologies and the information

38
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,479
they need to perform a task now this is

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,509
very important because we all need a

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,240
solid foundation however what to think

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,880
is a lot like fast food it's convenient

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,909
it's fast it's prepackaged and

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,950
oftentimes it's overly processed in the

44
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,770
form of regurgitated ideas and opinions

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,720
that do very little to contribute to our

46
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,920
deeper understanding

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,050
the world now mass media understands

48
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,420
this politicians certainly understand

49
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,390
this and I believe schools know this

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,160
take for example the news they repeat

51
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,330
the same message over and over and over

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,070
until we believe it

53
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,200
politicians crap four or five older

54
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,540
coins and repeat those over and over

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,520
schools they package content chunk it

56
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,820
and sequence it and then give us a test

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,250
to see if we can remember any of it this

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,740
makes the question then why are we

59
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,670
surprised when we find people that are

60
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:44,060
not as creative innovative and

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,440
passionate as they could be well this is

62
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,540
where the opportunity comes in we have

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,860
to shift our thinking that is in

64
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,650
addition to teaching people what to

65
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,320
think we also need to educate them on

66
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,910
how to think so for example if I teach

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,230
you what to think you can take what

68
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,290
you've learned and apply it to a similar

69
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,910
situation however if you learn how to

70
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,390
think you can take what you've learned

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,250
and adapt it to a multiple situations in

72
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,310
other words how to think is learning how

73
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:15,560
to learn or as we like to say it's to

74
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:17,480
learn unlearn and relearn quickly now my

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,580
mission is to help schools as well as

76
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,670
corporations find the optimal balance

77
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,019
between what and how and I've done this

78
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,720
by focusing really on two areas

79
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,980
cognitive neuroscience and computer

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,350
science now in cognitive neuroscience

81
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,480
what I'm looking for is how do we learn

82
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,600
that is how do we create new neural

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,570
pathways and looking at the impacts that

84
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,420
bias communications education has on

85
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,799
learning and memory and from a computer

86
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,690
science point of view looking for new

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
technologies that not only allow us to

88
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,340
study decision making but allow us to

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,630
create an environment that we can put

90
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,250
people in so they can learn how to think

91
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,070
so we've done this by creating highly

92
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,900
advanced computer-based simulations now

93
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,570
using these simulations we can challenge

94
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,880
participants to make decisions and solve

95
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,239
problems that are similar to the ones

96
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,830
that they face in their own organization

97
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,230
so not only do they learn how to think

98
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,890
about their own organization but we can

99
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,109
capture a significant amount of day

100
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:23,640
so we can assess their thinking over

101
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:25,470
time now this is what we found when

102
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,680
people have a lot of training that is a

103
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,130
lot of what to think training and

104
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,110
they're placed in these simulations and

105
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,870
they're confronted the problems that

106
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,620
they face in their real world most

107
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,140
participants resorted to guessing that

108
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,169
is when we give them more data tools

109
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:49,440
checklist choices their decision-making

110
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:53,610
did not improve if anything it got worse

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,830
so realizing that many of the challenges

112
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,500
that people face today are too big for

113
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,140
just one person we should get our focus

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,450
to looking at team performance so here

115
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,850
is our line of thinking we thought if we

116
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,680
can improve team performance how people

117
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,210
collaborate how they solve problems

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,770
together we can then improve their

119
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,220
overall thinking and hopefully their

120
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,960
decision-making so let me give you an

121
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,180
example let's say we're all part of a

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,890
big organization and a few of us have

123
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,620
been tasked with growing a certain

124
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,060
division of the organization so we get

125
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,010
together and I get it together with you

126
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,630
and I say hey what does growth mean to

127
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,890
you and you say well it's about

128
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,690
profitability and revenue I go to

129
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,330
someone else plays growth mean to you

130
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,729
you might say it is about people and

131
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,760
engagement and another person may say

132
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:45,120
well it's actually about market share

133
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,710
and price now all these are valid we're

134
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,390
excited to be part something new a new

135
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,100
initiative doing something important for

136
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,540
the organization so we get out there and

137
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,490
make a promise we're going to grow this

138
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,950
division by X percent over this period

139
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,419
in time then we get it back together

140
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,640
roll up our sleeves and start putting

141
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,300
our plans together and that's when it

142
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,850
fits us the realization that we all have

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,030
a very different perspective of what a

144
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:12,900
growth means when that happens conflict

145
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:15,360
happens we've all felt this I can easily

146
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,500
switch the word growth with community we

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
all have different perspectives on

148
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,410
community politics Wow lots of

149
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,510
perspectives their family relationships

150
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,849
actually I think there's lenses that

151
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:31,029
they call Mars and Venus

152
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:32,800
so realizing that when we feel conflict

153
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:36,580
because we have different perspectives

154
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,649
this can be demoralizing it can drain

155
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,659
our energy and erode our passion so

156
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:45,550
after about five years when honestly

157
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,019
felt like boiling the ocean trying to

158
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,610
find skills that improve team

159
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,499
performance I mean we tried everything

160
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,869
we tried teaching people conflict

161
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:54,519
resolution coaching and mentoring and

162
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:57,249
gave them checklists and processes and

163
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,889
tools the bottom line none of these

164
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:03,909
created the sustainable improvement that

165
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,769
we were looking for so when we're

166
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:08,379
looking for that improvement we decided

167
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:12,869
to step back and ask a different

168
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:17,229
question what did type top performers do

169
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:20,379
finally we found one skill that was

170
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,659
common to all top performers they

171
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,329
developed the ability to ask for the

172
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:27,759
questions now I know that sounds simple

173
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,649
but what they asked and how they asked

174
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,269
was very different for example many of

175
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,189
them were able to suspend their judgment

176
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:36,219
just long enough to understand someone

177
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:38,800
else's perspective and in doing so they

178
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:40,539
were able to reduce the conflict develop

179
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,199
a common language and create a shared

180
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:49,269
vision so as the situation evolved so do

181
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,949
their thinking now I know we all ask a

182
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,539
lot of questions and that's a really

183
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,300
good thing we want people to be asking

184
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,849
lots and lots of questions but what we

185
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,479
found however is that most questions are

186
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:04,929
safe that is they surface what is

187
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,899
already seen or understood they lead to

188
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:10,649
regurgitated ideas and opinions in other

189
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:15,489
words most questions that people ask

190
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:16,959
really surface what is already known now

191
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:18,729
top performers however they ask

192
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,949
questions that go deep they ask

193
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,389
questions that move us from automatic

194
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,309
and reactionary thinking to deep

195
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,649
thinking ask questions that inspire

196
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:30,129
creativity fuel passion and lead to

197
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:31,520
profound ideas and most importantly they

198
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:35,990
ask questions that spur

199
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,669
- in other words they ask questions that

200
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:46,220
demystify the unknown and in doing so

201
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:48,440
open up an ocean of possibilities now

202
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,600
our brain is an amazing searchable

203
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,420
database linking emotions memories

204
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,959
events and experiences together to form

205
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,800
answers to our endless questions the

206
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,779
success of the good answer however

207
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,440
relies on the words we choose our words

208
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:09,529
have amazing power on our brain how we

209
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,260
use words in framing our questions is

210
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,640
what differentiates a good question from

211
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,040
a bad question let me give you an

212
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,360
example when we saw people put into the

213
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,880
simulation that were confronted with

214
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,040
these challenges and they started to

215
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,020
make decisions the teams that were

216
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,720
struggling would ask what should we do

217
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,860
it was almost as though the options in

218
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,670
front of them were just narrowed down

219
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,310
and they became very short-term focused

220
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,720
whereas other teams would ask what could

221
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,690
we do it was like the ocean of

222
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,980
possibilities opened up to them now the

223
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,020
same is true for the types of questions

224
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,750
we asked herself for example if I ask

225
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,520
why do I always procrastinate my brain

226
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,380
will surely tell me it's because I'm

227
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,630
lazy because they have too much to do I

228
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,660
don't know where to get started however

229
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,970
I slightly reframe that and say how am I

230
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:00,260
going to get this done my brain will

231
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,180
surely find a better answer now I know

232
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,700
if I was sitting out in where you are

233
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,959
right now I would say so what there's

234
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,399
got to be a lot more to this than just

235
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,410
framing questions well there is I

236
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,980
believe that since we've been taught

237
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,770
what to think for so long that the very

238
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,110
idea of asking a question that triggers

239
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,260
deep thinking evokes so many different

240
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,410
emotions it creates uncertainty fear

241
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,959
anxiety stress these are all very very

242
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,200
real biological reactions to questions

243
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,450
and from a neuroscience perspective to

244
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,459
much of any of these can impair our

245
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,370
learning ability to connect ability

246
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:42,170
elicits

247
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:46,320
with one another so what we found is

248
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:50,940
that the individuals who would embrace

249
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,740
these emotions that is understand that

250
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,370
these are just part of the natural

251
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,710
process and asking good questions and

252
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,660
allowing questions to do their work then

253
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,060
questions can really start to make a

254
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,600
difference so a good question will

255
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,410
expose our bias a good question will

256
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,060
surface our beliefs and oftentimes

257
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,600
questions will expose that we may not

258
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,430
know something as well as we think we do

259
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,350
now these are good things to have happen

260
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,470
because when this happens learning can

261
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,450
take place this is when people can come

262
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,100
connect it this is when they can create

263
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,920
relatedness and understanding and

264
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,500
believe in one another this is when

265
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,610
people can work together to adapt their

266
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,240
thinking so now the good news is that

267
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:41,010
I've seen kids parents coaches

268
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,630
businesspeople and even politicians

269
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,779
break through these emotional and mental

270
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:50,490
barriers and learn to become confident

271
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:53,910
in asking good questions now there are a

272
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,209
lot of challenges in this world we all

273
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:00,209
have them whether in our business in our

274
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:03,570
cities in our schools and our families

275
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:05,520
in our relationships we all have them we

276
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,589
all have a very different lens on what

277
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,470
these challenges are and how to address

278
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:11,760
them and this is a really good thing

279
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,700
because I believe that most of these

280
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:19,500
problems are too big for one person and

281
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,600
we really need each other what if what

282
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,930
if you learned how to ask good questions

283
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,480
every day what if tomorrow when you went

284
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,830
to meet with somebody you seek to

285
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,089
understand them instead of trying to be

286
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:34,560
understood what if before in every

287
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,630
important meeting you took the time to

288
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,730
write down questions that would move the

289
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,980
conversation from the known to the

290
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,440
unknown

291
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,570
what if executives led by questions not

292
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,220
by questioning but asking questions that

293
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,990
inspired others to think about what they

294
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,350
could do

295
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:54,200
now what they should do what if churches

296
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,660
synagogues mosque ask how long we to

297
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,590
live instead of focusing on whether

298
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,490
others don't do what if parents ask

299
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,060
their kids

300
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,770
what great question did you ask today

301
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:10,490
instead of asking what did you learn

302
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,190
today with questions you get what you

303
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,960
asked for and in an era in which

304
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,590
computers are getting better at

305
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,770
answering questions we need people who

306
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,890
are getting better at asking questions

307
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,890
thank you
