# Workshop #1: How to make the most of the conference

This workshop has a focus on the *networking* side (I think I used the word 'social' in my slides. I may organise workshops on 'how to ask good questions' and 'how to make good presentations' in the future). 

**Target audience**: graduate students and early-career researchers.

**Time**: 2 hours would be ideal to cover all discussions, tips and practices designed for the workshop.
