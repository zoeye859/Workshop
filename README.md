# Workshop #1: How to make the most of the conference

This workshop has a focus on the *networking* side (I think I used the word 'social' in my slides. I may organise workshops on 'how to ask good questions' and 'how to make good presentations' in the future). 

**Files**: Inside the folder *Conference Networking Workshop*

**Target audience**: graduate students and early-career researchers.

**Time**: 2 hours would be ideal to cover all discussions, tips and practices designed for the workshop.

(Event time: Sept 24 2020, School of Astronomy and Space Sciences, Nanjing University, China)

## Survey 

Out of 22 participants, 18 filled in the workshop survey. According to the survey results:

- 17 out of 18 participants found the workshop useful or very useful.
- 10 out of 18 participants feel more confident attending a conference next time, while 8 feel more confident but limited (in other words, they still don't feel so confident for conferences). This may suggest that there are other aspects of a conference needs to be covered in the future.
- 16 out of 18 participants feel very the presenter (Zoe) has done a great job, yayyyy!

In addition, some workshop topics are suggested:

- How to ask better questions
- How to find passion/interests (Wow!!)
- How to organse my life as a graduate student
- How to seek research collaborators
- Time management
- Data processing/Software workshop
- Share insights on heated research topics
- Career planning
- Relationship with colleagues and/or supervisors.

These are all informative feedbacks! I am very grateful!

# Workshop #2 : How to decide the intensity of asking something or saying no

This mini workshop has a focus on how to make requests or say no. 


Many people have problems of requesting things or saying no, even when doing so is compeletely legitimate. Also, some may struggle to choose the right intensity to make their requests and saying no. It is very common to think "Was my tone too aggresive?" "Did I annoy that person because I said no?" "I should have been more assertive or that person would not reject me" over and over again after a stressful situation where you request something or say no to someone.

This workshop introduces a framwork proposed by **Marsha M. Lineman**, from her book: *DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets*. It is very straightforward, and most importantly, useful. After learning the frame work and how to use it, you can download an app called **he Dime Game** to practice this framework whenever you need.
