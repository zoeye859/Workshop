# Workshop #1: How to make the most of the conference

This workshop has a focus on the networking side (I think I use the word 'social' in my slides. I may organise workshops on 'how to ask good questions' and 'how to make good presentations' in the future). 

The target audience is graduate students and early-career researchers.
