# Workshop #1: How to make the most of the conference

This workshop has a focus on the *networking* side (I think I used the word 'social' in my slides. I may organise workshops on 'how to ask good questions' and 'how to make good presentations' in the future). 

**Files**: Inside the folder *Conference Networking Workshop*

**Target audience**: graduate students and early-career researchers.

**Time**: 2 hours would be ideal to cover all discussions, tips and practices designed for the workshop.

(Event time: Sept 24 2020, School of Astronomy and Space Sciences, Nanjing University, China)

## Survey 

Out of 22 participants, 18 filled in the workshop survey. According to the survey results:

- 17 out of 18 participants found the workshop useful or very useful.
- 10 out of 18 participants feel more confident attending a conference next time, while 8 feel more confident but limited (in other words, they still don't feel so confident for conferences). This may suggest that there are other aspects of a conference needs to be covered in the future.
- 16 out of 18 participants feel very the presenter (Zoe) has done a great job, yayyyy!

In addition, some workshop topics are suggested:

- How to ask better questions
- How to find passion/interests (Wow!!)
- How to organse my life as a graduate student
- How to seek research collaborators
- Time management
- Data processing/Software workshop
- Share insights on heated research topics
- Career planning
- Relationship with colleagues and/or supervisors.

These are all informative feedbacks! I am very grateful!
